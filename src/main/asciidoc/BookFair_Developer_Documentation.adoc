== 1. Introduction

*Project Name:* Book Fair Management System  
*Client:* Leifurter Buchmessen AG  
*Version:* 1.0  
*Date:* April 29, 2025

This system aims to modernize the organization of book fairs by Leifurter Buchmessen AG. The web-based application enables efficient digital management of sales stands, equipment, booking data, and statistics. It supports publishers, fair organizers, and provides a foundation for scalable future expansion.

- Must integrate with existing personnel management and accounting systems.

=== Operational Constraints
- Should be deployable on-premises or via cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure).
