= Developer Documentation â€“ Book Fair Management System
:toc:

== 1. Introduction

*Project Name:* Book Fair Management System  
*Client:* Leifurter Buchmessen AG  
*Version:* 1.0  
*Date:* April 29, 2025

This system aims to modernize the organization of book fairs by Leifurter Buchmessen AG. The web-based application enables efficient digital management of sales stands, equipment, booking data, and statistics. It supports publishers, fair organizers, and provides a foundation for scalable future expansion.

== 2. Constraints

=== Hardware Constraints
- Server infrastructure to support a web-based system.
- On-site client machines or tablets for check-in or stand management (optional).

=== Software Constraints
- Web application must be compatible with modern browsers.
- Must integrate with existing personnel management and accounting systems.

=== Operational Constraints
- Should be deployable on-premises or via cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure).
- Must comply with GDPR (EU data protection).
- Must support scaling with additional exhibition halls (currently 3, planned 7 total).

== 3. Context and Boundaries

=== Actors
- Fair Organizers (Admin users)
- Publishers (Customers)
- Financial Staff
- External Equipment Providers

=== Primary Interfaces
- Web frontend for internal and external users
- Integration with financial systems and event calendar

== 4. Solution Strategy

=== 4.1. Meeting Quality Goals

[options="header", cols="1,1"]
===
|Quality Goal |Solution Approach
|Maintainability a|
* *Modularity* The application is built from individual modules so that changes in one place affect only a few other parts.
* *Reusability* Individual components should be usable by other systems.
* *Modifiability* The application should be expandable or modifiable without introducing errors.
|Usability a|
* *Learnability* The system should be easy for users to understand, for example through clear labeling of buttons and input fields.
* *Error handling/User protection* Invalid inputs must be detected and must not lead to invalid system states.
* *Accessibility* It must be ensured that various potentially impaired individuals can use the system, for example by using appropriate font sizes and color contrasts.
|Security a|
* *Confidentiality* The system must ensure that only authorized persons have access to information. This is handled using _Spring Security_ and _Thymeleaf_ (`sec:authorize` tag).
* *Integrity* The system must prevent unauthorized modification of data. This can be achieved using _Spring Security_ (`@PreAuthorize` annotation).

=== 4.2. Software Architecture

Top-Level Architecture:
- Frontend: React.js (SPA)
- Backend: Django or Node.js-based API
- Database: PostgreSQL
- External Systems: ERP/HR systems integration via API

=== 4.3. Key Design Decisions

- Persistence Layer: ORM-based access to PostgreSQL
- Design Patterns: MVC, Repository, Singleton for shared resources
- UI Components: Modular components with role-based views

Frameworks:

[options="header", cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Library / Tool | Usage | Reason
| React | Frontend UI | Fast development, reusable
| Django REST API | Backend | Built-in admin, DRY
| Chart.js | Visualization | Statistics and analytics
|===

== 5. Building Block View

=== Modules / Packages
- Authentication & User Roles
- Stand Management
- Equipment Inventory
- Booking System
- Statistics Dashboard

=== Key Classes

[options="header", cols="1,1"]
|===
| Class/Enum | Description
| User | Represents staff or publisher logins
| Fair | Book fair event with halls and dates
| Stand | Rentable space with pricing and category info
| Booking | Stand rental + equipment requests
| Report | Aggregates stats for organizers
|===

=== 5.1. Traceability

[options="header", cols="1,1"]
|===
| Requirement (Pflichtenheft) | Design Class
| Stand booking management | Booking, Stand
| Equipment tracking | EquipmentItem, Booking
| Event statistics (visitors, revenue, etc.) | Report, Fair
| Publisher profile and contract tracking | User, Booking
|===

== 6. Runtime View

=== Booking Process (Suggested Sequence)
1. Publisher logs in
2. Selects a fair and available stand
3. Chooses equipment
4. Confirms booking
5. System sends confirmation and updates database
